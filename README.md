# gsplat.js

#### JavaScript Gaussian Splatting library

gsplat.js is an easy-to-use, general-purpose, open-source 3D Gaussian Splatting library, providing functionality similar to [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) but for Gaussian Splatting.

### Installation

#### Configure Development Environment

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Skip this step if you already have a development environment capable of importing ES6 modules.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
2. Create a new [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) project, or your preferred ES6 module bundler.

```
npm create vite@latest
```

When asked, select `vanilla` as the framework and `typescript` as the language.

3. Validate that your development environment is working by running the following commands:

```
cd <your-project-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

If everything is working, you should see a "Hello, Vite!" message at `http://localhost:5173` or the printed address in your terminal.

#### Install with NPM

1. Install gsplat.js using NPM.

```
npm install --save-dev gsplat
```

### Usage

#### Creating a Scene

This code creates a scene, camera, and renderer, and loads splatting data from a URL.

main.ts --
```

```
